1. State Trie

Key: keccak256(address) â†’ 32-byte hash (64 nibbles)
Value: RLP-encoded account (nonce, balance, storageRoot, codeHash)

2. Storage Trie (per account)

Key: keccak256(storage_slot_index)
Value: RLP-encoded storage value (e.g., uint256)

3. Transaction Trie / Receipt Trie

Key: the RLP-encoded transaction index (an integer like 0, 1, 2, ...), then converted to a byte array (i.e., RLP of the number)
Value: RLP-encoded transaction object / transaction receipt

ðŸ”· 1. State Trie

Key: keccak256(address) (64 hex nibbles)

Value: RLP-encoded account object:

[
  nonce,
  balance,
  storageRoot,
  codeHash
]


Size: ~100â€“150 bytes (depends on account complexity)

storageRoot and codeHash are 32-byte hashes.

balance and nonce can be variable-length integers.

ðŸ”· 2. Storage Trie (one per account)

Key: keccak256(slot_index)

Value: RLP-encoded storage value (usually a 256-bit integer)

Size: ~1â€“33 bytes (RLP compresses leading zeros)

But can be more if storing complex packed data manually.

ðŸ”· 3. Transaction Trie

Key: RLP(transaction index)

Value: RLP(transaction object)

Legacy transaction: often ~100â€“200 bytes

EIP-1559 transactions: even larger due to new fields (access lists, etc.)

Can go beyond 500 bytes if calldata is large.

ðŸ”· 4. Receipt Trie

Key: RLP(transaction index)

Value: RLP(receipt)

Includes logs, bloom filter, gas used, status

Logs can be deeply nested and data-rich

Size: ~100â€“1000+ bytes, depending on how many logs were emitted
